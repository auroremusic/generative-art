Hello there! Here is a freshly new repo with some of my
processing/p5.js code. Much more to come later. Enjoy!

## Processing

- press `a` to display/hide the parameters window
- press `e` to exit
- press `g` to take a new random SEED
- press `r` to record the drawing in a `.svg`. Don't forget to press `r` again to stop recording before trying other random SEED

### Subdivision

A rather classic subdivision algorithm based on recursion. You should get drawings of this form
